## About Fenris Manor

Fenris Manor is a game heavily influenced by Castlevania 1-4. These games were a large part of my childhood and continued to influence my adult life. The game will tell the story of Izabell Solis as she fights her way through the manor of the Werewolf King, Fenris. Izabell has been tasked with purging the land of the evils that reside within the manor and protecting the nearby village. The manor is home to not only the Werewolf King but also home to many other frightening creatures.

There are currently 6 stages planned for the full game, though more may be added as goals are met. Each stage will have 1 boss and several enemies unique strictly to it, while there will also be enemies that are shared among all stages. The current tiers are enemies that have been designed for the first stage, up to and including the first boss, the Voidwolf. I will post more details and more images as new enemies are created. These posts will be available to everyone, not just patrons.

## Who am I?

I am widely known as LynxTheCat, on Twitch, Twitter, Discord, now Patreon, and many other places. I have been a gamer for my entire life. I grew up carrying around the old grey brick (Game Boy) everywhere I went. I graduated from college in May of 2018 with a Computer Science degree and am currently looking to start my career in Game Development with this project. This is the first project Iâ€™m working on that will be finished. The previous games I had started were all learning experiences or group projects that fell apart quickly.

Prior to this game, I had never done any pixel art before. A lot of early time was spent learning how to work with art tools to and designing the characters and enemies. I feel that I have gotten more efficient and proficient at using these tools and will be able to create more enemies at a much quicker pace than I have up to know.

## When This Project Started and Goals

I started designing and doing artwork for this project in January 2019, and I pushed myself to learn many new skills to create this wonderful pixelated world. I took a few months off from development to try to find a job and start my professional career, unsuccessfully. I decided to launch this Patreon in hopes that I may be able to remain focused on finishing this project and achieve my dreams of making games. I have many other games planned beyond this one, and I will end up discussing all those plans here.

I revitalized this project near my birthday in July 2019. I have put a lot of extra effort into getting features done on this project, and I hope to have most of the player controls done by the end of August. This would make for an awesome start for the project. Currently, the basic movement controls, jump controls, and stair controls are completed. I feel like I need to tweak both the basic movement controls and jump controls a bit, because the player currently has too much control while in midair.
